These are scripts that work toward the goal of taking triples from ARC2 and move them into Marmotta, storing each node as a LDP Container..see the combine script with the require_once statements to see how things fit together...also see the libre office presentation...  Run combinescripts.php which requires just two files in this repository: selectsubjectpredicateobject.php and multiimplodekey.php .
